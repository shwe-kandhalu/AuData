Extract these elements into a JSON object. RULES:

1. STATED elements — preserve the user's literal phrasing. Never paraphrase
   "Mediterranean diet" as "dietary intervention", or "longevity" as "BMI", or
   "cancer" as "neoplasm". The exact words the user wrote must appear.

2. UNSTATED elements — supply a BROAD, INCLUSIVE default that does not conflict
   with the stated topic. Prefer breadth over specificity.

3. NEVER override what the user did state. If the user wrote "Mediterranean diet",
   the intervention is "Mediterranean diet" — never "low-carb diet" or
   "diet intervention".

4. EVERY PICO field must be a SPECIFIC, OPERATIONALISED phrase (5–18 words),
   not a single bare word or a rambling list. Push for concreteness: name the
   subgroup, the dose / duration / adherence index, the comparator type, the
   validated outcome measure. The user's clarifying answers (if any) are folded
   into the goal text — use them. Examples of strong phrasings:
     • Population: "Community-dwelling adults aged 40+ with cardiovascular risk factors"
     • Population: "Older adults (65+ years) without established cardiovascular disease"
     • Intervention: "Adherence to a Mediterranean diet measured by validated index (e.g. MedDiet Score)"
     • Intervention: "Metformin monotherapy at standard daily doses (≥ 1000 mg/day)"
     • Comparator: "Standard Western diet or no specific dietary intervention"
     • Comparator: "Placebo or active control (sulfonylurea or DPP-4 inhibitor)"
     • Outcome: "All-cause mortality and lifespan, with follow-up ≥ 5 years"
     • Outcome: "Change in HbA1c (%) from baseline at 6 months or later"

5. Generate 5–7 inclusion criteria and 5–7 exclusion criteria. Each criterion
   should be a SPECIFIC, OPERATIONALISED sentence (8–22 words) — concrete
   enough that two reviewers screening the same paper would reach the same
   decision. Include numeric thresholds, validated scales, and design
   restrictions where reasonable. Cover, between the two lists, the standard
   methodological dimensions:
     • study design (RCT preference, prospective observational floor, follow-up duration)
     • population restriction (age, comorbidity, exposure window)
     • intervention / comparator operationalisation (dose, duration, adherence measure)
     • outcome measurement (validated scale, timing, hard vs surrogate endpoint)
     • methodological quality (sample size, attrition, blinding, language, full-text)
   Avoid circular boilerplate ("studies relevant to this research question"),
   and avoid generic one-word criteria ("English") — embed them in a sentence.

You are an expert clinical search librarian building a HIGH-SENSITIVITY PubMed search.
For each PICO concept below, produce a COMPREHENSIVE set of search terms so the final
query captures every relevant paper — thorough, not generic, and not missing variants.
DO NOT write any PubMed syntax — no square brackets, quotes, Boolean operators, or
parentheses. Just the plain term strings.

PICO concepts to expand:
  intervention/exposure: {intervention_clean or "(none)"}
  outcome:               {outcome_clean or "(none)"}
  population:            {population_clean or "(none)"}

For each concept, the free-text synonym list should COVER THE WHOLE CONCEPT, including:
  • the user's exact phrase(s), verbatim
  • singular/plural and hyphenation variants (e.g. "pet owner", "pet owners", "pet-owner")
  • British and American spellings (e.g. "behaviour"/"behavior")
  • common abbreviations / acronyms AND their expansions (e.g. "T2DM", "type 2 diabetes")
  • lay and technical phrasings authors actually use
  • closely related wording for the SAME concept (e.g. "cat ownership" → "pet ownership",
    "companion animal", "feline", "owning a cat")
Stay on-concept: do NOT drift to a different idea or over-broaden into unrelated topics.
Also give the relevant PubMed MeSH headings, including closely related / narrower headings.

Return ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:
{{
  "intervention_synonyms": [ "...", ...],   // 6-15 thorough synonyms / variants
  "intervention_mesh":     [ "...", ...],   // 1-4 MeSH controlled-vocabulary headings
  "outcome_synonyms":      [ "...", ...],   // 6-15
  "outcome_mesh":          [ "...", ...],   // 1-4
  "population_synonyms":   [ "...", ...],   // [] if the population is broad (all adults / humans)
  "population_mesh":       [ "...", ...]
}}

EXAMPLES:
  For intervention = "Mediterranean diet":
    intervention_synonyms: ["Mediterranean diet", "Mediterranean dietary pattern",
                            "Mediterranean-style diet", "Med diet", "MedDiet",
                            "Mediterranean eating pattern", "Cretan diet"]
    intervention_mesh:     ["Diet, Mediterranean"]

  For outcome = "longevity":
    outcome_synonyms: ["longevity", "lifespan", "life span", "life expectancy",
                       "all-cause mortality", "survival", "aging", "ageing", "healthspan"]
    outcome_mesh:     ["Longevity", "Mortality", "Aging"]

  For population = "humans" (broad → no narrowing terms):
    population_synonyms: []
    population_mesh:     []

NEVER paraphrase the user's stated terms — if the intervention says "Mediterranean diet",
the phrase "Mediterranean diet" MUST appear in intervention_synonyms exactly as written.

             (drop the last AND-joined concept; strip MeSH-only filters).

        AGENTIC REFINEMENT STRATEGY:
        1. Analyze the current query for:
           - Missing synonyms for key terms
           - Overly restrictive operators
           - Missing MeSH terms
           - Incorrect field tags
        
        2. Apply these optimization rules:
           - Expand population terms with synonyms (e.g., "adults" → "adult" OR "adults" OR "aged")
           - Add alternative spellings and British/American variants
           - Include broader MeSH terms where appropriate
           - Add wildcard (*) for root words with multiple endings
           - Balance AND/OR operators to avoid too restrictive combinations
        
        3. ENSURE the query is HIGH-SENSITIVITY (broad) for screening:
           - Better to catch more and filter later than miss relevant papers
           - Use OR liberally within concept groups
           - Keep AND only between major concept groups (Pop/Int)
        
        CRITICAL: Return ONLY the optimized PubMed search string.

        TASK: Generate 4-5 specific, actionable refinement suggestions that will improve the precision and relevance of this systematic review.
        
        ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS:
        1. Population scope: Are we too broad/narrow? Consider age groups, conditions, settings
        2. Intervention specificity: Should we focus on specific drugs, therapies, or approaches?
        3. Outcome precision: Can we target more specific clinical endpoints or measurements?
        4. Study design: Should we limit to RCTs, meta-analyses, or observational studies?
        5. Timeframe: Should we specify publication date ranges or follow-up periods?
        6. Geographic scope: Should we focus on specific regions or healthcare settings?
        7. Comparison clarity: Can we better define control or alternative treatments?
        
        SUGGESTION CRITERIA:
        - Be specific and actionable (not generic)
        - Target common systematic review refinement strategies
        - Consider PICO framework improvements
        - Address potential gaps in current search
        - Suggest methodological filters
        - Include clinical or demographic specifics
        - Consider intervention delivery mechanisms
        - Target outcome measurement specificity
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT:
        Return ONLY a JSON list of strings, each being a specific refinement suggestion.
        
        EXAMPLES OF GOOD SUGGESTIONS:
        - "Focus on randomized controlled trials published after 2015"
        - "Limit to adult patients with type 2 diabetes (>18 years)"
        - "Specify metformin dosage ranges (500-2000mg daily)"
        - "Include studies with minimum 12-month follow-up period"

        STRICTLY screen this paper based on PICO and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.
        
        PICO:
        - Pop: {pico.population} | Int: {pico.intervention} | Comp: {pico.comparator} | Out: {pico.outcome}
        
        CRITERIA:

        PAPER:
        Title: {paper.title}
        Abstract: {paper.abstract}

        SCREENING RULES:
        1. Check ALL inclusion criteria - paper must meet EVERY inclusion criterion to be included
        2. Check exclusion criteria - paper fails if it matches ANY exclusion criterion
        3. Be systematic but CAUTIOUS - evaluate each criterion individually
        4. If abstract is ambiguous or lacks detail, DEFAULT TO 'INCLUDE' to avoid false exclusions
        5. Only exclude if CLEARLY irrelevant or strong exclusion criteria are met

        TASK:
        1. Decision: Error on the side of INCLUSION. Only exclude if clearly irrelevant or strong exclusion criteria met.
        2. Bucket: Select 3-5 words from the criteria above that best explains the decision
        3. Reason: Explain which specific criteria were met/not met. If ambiguous, state "Abstract lacks sufficient detail"
        4. Criteria Evaluation: For EACH criterion in the inclusion and exclusion lists above, evaluate whether the paper meets it. Return "INCLUDE" if the paper meets the criterion, "EXCLUDE" if it does not.

        CRITICAL: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. No conversational text, no explanations, no markdown formatting.
        
        REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:
        {{
            "decision": "Include", 
            "bucket": "All criteria met", 
            "reason": "Meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria",

        CRITERIA EVALUATION:
        For EACH criterion in the inclusion and exclusion lists above, evaluate whether the paper meets it.
        Return "INCLUDE" if the paper meets the criterion, "EXCLUDE" if it does not.
        
        AI REASONING SUMMARY:
